# AWS Terraform Demos

This repository contains my daily practice projects on AWS using Terraform.
I’m exploring Infrastructure as Code by building different demo environments and documenting my progress here.
The projects are beginner-friendly experiments that help me strengthen my understanding of AWS and Terraform.
